Experience
----------

### Starcom Media Vest Group
**SEO/Growth Hacking**
**(Apr 2013&mdash;May 2014)**

  - My clients include: Honda, Stub Hub, Novartis. 
  - My Role could be described/split into two big areas – (Technical) UX/CRO/SEO Consultancy/Implementation and Content Creation.
  - The former can involve anything ranging from something as simple as meta titles and descriptions (to drive click through on search results) and keyword research to something as complex cross sites caching problems. 
  - Content Creation part involves me building blogs, web apps, dashboards (where data is being pulled via various APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Analytics, Majestic etc.) and visualised dynamically) for clients and internal teams.


### 1st Page Prophets
**SEM/SEO Consultant**
**(Sep 2012&mdash;Apr 2013)**

  - SEO, PPC, CRO, Social Media, Business Development, Email Marketing, Automation

  - E.g. creating, managing and maintaining PPC and SEO campaigns for my clients as well as weekly reporting (Google Analytics/Excel) in order to achieve and exceed desired KPIs and ROI. 
  - On-Page (keyword research, on site architecture, On-Page optimization etc.) and Off-Page SEO (social bookmarking, link building, bad links removal (especially after penguin), bloggers outreach, social media channeling, PR etc). 
  - Heavy use of AWR (advanced web rankings) and Google Analytics for analysis/reporting among other tools. 
  - Also, doing CRO – Conversion Rate Optimization, hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel="prev" and rel="next" values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation


### NHS (CIMA/Finance)
**Management Accountant**

  - 6 month placement in Financial Accounting which should include supporting the annual close down and preparation of the Annual Accounts and related financial statements, and also also value for money assessments; 
  - 12 month placement in Management Accounting where the emphasis is on the trainee engaging with and advising budget holders within  the  organisation, project based working with other professions, and also during this period having experience of the Audit Function;
  - 3 month ‘flexi placement’ in another organisation such as a Local Authority, Department of Health, third sector or alternatively a private sector organisation  that either links to health and social care or offers learning experiences that can be applied in an NHS setting. 



### BBSRC Research Project, University of Sheffield
**Identification of amino acid residues involved in transmembrane signalling via the high-affinity receptor complex for IgE**
**(Jul 2009&mdash;Aug 2009)**

  - Undergraduate research summer studentship supervised by Dr Brigit Helm. Investigated mutagenesis of amino acids residues in the transmembrane region of the ligand binding and signal transducing subunits of the high affinity receptor complex for IgE, which may further our understanding of the early stages in downstream signalling and provide information for the design of small molecular inhibitors specific for this process which have applications in the treatment of IgE-mediated allergies. Project involved the application of combination of molecular biological techniques (site directed mutagenesis, gene sequencing, gene transfection), cell biology (e.g. FACS, flow cytometry), analysis of downstream signalling pathways (receptor phosphorylation, immunoprecipitation and Calcium mobilization studies), ELISA, handling mammalian cell lines along with analytical techniques such as SDS – PAGE, PCR, western and southern blot analysis.


### Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Clinical Chemistry Department
**Student Summer Placement**
**(Jun 2009)**

  - Undertaking a placement as a Work Experience Student in the Clinical Chemistry Department, under supervision of Mr Martin Loxley or a member of laboratory staff.
